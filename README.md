# Éternité
Eternite is a unique indie escape game that involves solving arithmetic and logic puzzles that are built upon a romance story. There are multiple endings and the difficulty level that the player choose to play will result in different endings.

## Preamble
You are in an empty room, tied to a chair when you woke up.
You somehow managed to remove the ropes, but the door is locked.
To escape, you need to figure out the truth. 
The difficuly level you choose will determine your final fate.

## Future Work
To be implemented on a github pages website for the game to be available even without the hardware. :) 
Look forward to it. 

## The Detailed Report of the Game
