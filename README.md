# Éternité
Eternite is a unique indie escape game that involves solving arithmetic and logic puzzles that are built upon a romance story. There are multiple endings and the difficulty level that the player choose to play will result in different endings.

## Basic Description
You will be roleplaying as Blaine in an empty room, who is tied to a chair as he woke up. 
You somehow managed to remove the ropes, but the door is locked.
To escape, you need to figure out the truth. 
The difficuly level you choose will determine Blaine's final fate.

## How to play
Start off with the instruction booklet then read the corresponding difficulty level booklet for the difficulty that you want to attempt the game in.
